Kotlin

- Runs anywhere the JVM can Run
- Statically typed
- Object-oriented
- Functional programming

Four guiding principles
- Conciseness
- Safety: No null
- Pragmatism: no research based - Practical
- Interoperability: Designed to be interoperable with Java


Declaring Variables:
Val number = 25
Val number: Int = 25

Val employee1 = Employee(�Utsav Shrestha�, 500)
Employee1.name = �Rishav Shrestha�

We can change the value of a val by using .specifier

Class Employee(var name: String, val id: Int){
}


Differences between Java and Kotlin
1. In Kotlin, there�s no need to put semicolon at the end.
2. We cannot use keyword unless for intended purpose in Java, there are soft and hard keywords in Kotlin.
3. Kotlin has its own string class.Check String documentation
4. Exceptions: In Java, it is necessary to declare exceptions. In Kotlin, it doesn�t difference between exceptions.
5. Ternary Operator: No longer in Kotlin
6. For Loops: Different for loops compared to Java
7. Kotlin doesn�t have static keyword.
8. We don�t have to use New keyword.

Structural equality is == in Kotlin
Referential equality is === in Kotlin

Operators in Kotlin:
�or� and �and�

Any is a placeholding
Is checks the type of instance

String Template
Use $ to reference variables inside a string

Raw Strings
Triple quoted string. Which is useful for filepath.
Don't need to add line change with triple quote. Use function trimMargin to indent.


fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    val car = Car("blue", "Toyota", 2015)
    println(car) -> Prints car(color=blue, model=Toyota, year=2015)

    val car2 = Car("blue", "Toyota", 2015)
    println(car==car2) -> Prints true

    val car3 = car.copy()
    println(car3) -> Prints car(color=blue, model=Toyota, year=2015)

    val car4 = car.copy(year=2016, color = "green")
    println(car4) -> Prints car(color=green, model=Toyota, year=2016)
}

data class Car(val color: String, val model: String, val year: Int) {

}
